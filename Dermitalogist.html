      <h2><u>overview  of Hair Transplant</u></h2>
      <h3> What to Expect</h3>
      <ul>
 <li>
    Like good health and youth, most of us take our locks for granted -- that is, until they're gone. For many people, a hair transplant can help bring back what looks like a full -- or at least a fuller -- head of hair.</li>
<li>
    If thinning up top or going bald really bothers you, the procedure can be one way to feel more confident about your looks. But first talk with your doctor about what you can expect during and after the surgery.
 </li>

 <h3>What Is a Hair Transplant?</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>
        It's a type of surgery that moves hair you already have to fill an area with thin or no hair. Doctors have been doing these transplants in the U.S. since the 1950s, but techniques have changed a lot in recent years.</li>
<li>
       You usually have the procedure in the doctor's office. First, the surgeon cleans your scalp and injects medicine to numb the back of your head. Your doctor will choose one of two methods for the transplant: follicular unit strip surgery (FUSS) or follicular unit extraction (FUE).With FUSS, the surgeon removes a 6- to 10-inch strip of skin from the back of your head. They set it aside and sews the scalp closed. This area is immediately hidden by the hair around it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Hair grafts – Hair Grafts are tiny pieces of scalp containing one or two hairs are harvested for a healthy part of the head (usually the back of the head) and transplanted to a bald area of the scalp. Often referred to as hair plugs.
    </li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Expectations and Recovery</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>
        After the surgery, your scalp may be very tender. You may need to take pain medications for several days. Your surgeon will have you wear bandages over your scalp for at least a day or two. They may also prescribe an antibiotic or an anti-inflammatory drug for you to take for several days. Most people are able to return to work 2 to 5 days after the operation. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Within 2 to 3 weeks after surgery, the transplanted hair will fall out, but you should start to notice new growth within a few months. Most people will see 60% of new hair growth after 6 to 9 months. Some surgeons prescribe the hair-growing drug minoxidil (Rogaine) to improve hair growth after transplantation, but it’s not clear how well it works.
    </li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Risks and Costs of Treatment </h3>
 <ul>
    <li>
        As with any kind of surgery, transplants have some risks, including bleeding and infection. There’s also the chance for scarring and unnatural-looking new hair growth. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Around the time new locks start to grow, some people have inflammation or an infection of the hair follicles, called folliculitis. Antibiotics and compresses can relieve the problem. It’s also possible to suddenly lose some of the original hair in the area where you got the new strands, called shock loss. But most of the time, it’s not permanent.
    </li>
    <li>
        Talk with your doctor about these risks and how much improvement you’re likely to get from the surgery. They can help you decide if it's a good option for you.
    </li>
 </ul>
 <h3>What happens during a hair transplant?</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>
        After thoroughly cleaning your scalp, a surgeon uses a small needle to numb an area of your head with local anesthesia.
    </li>
    <li>
        Two main techniques are used to obtain follicles for transplantation: FUT and FUE.</li>
    <li>
        In follicular unit transplantation (FUT):

       <li> 1.The surgeon will use a scalpel to cut out a strip of scalp skin from the back of the head. The incision is typically several inches long.</li>
       <li>2. This is then closed with stitches.</li>
       <li> 3.The surgeon next separates the removed portion of scalp into small sections using a magnifying lens and sharp surgical knife. When implanted, these sections will help achieve natural-looking hair growth.</li>
    </li>
 </ul>

 <h2>lasik Treatment</h2>
 <h3>What is lasik Treatment</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        LASIK, also known as ‘laser-assisted in situ keratomileuses’, is a laser eye procedure performed to treat various vision-related problems. In LASIK surgery, the cornea is reshaped which enables the light entering into the eye to focus on the retina properly for clearer vision. In the majority of cases, LASIK surgery is completed in 15-20 minutes. It is a pain-free procedure and vision is improved without the need for eyeglasses or contact lenses.
    </li>
</ul>

    <h3>TYPES OF LASIK SURGERY</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        If you are a good LASIK candidate, your eye surgeon will advise the best surgical option. Here are some common types of LASIK surgery options:
    </li>
    <li>
        LASIK: It is the most popular form of laser eye surgery which involves creating a hinged flap in the eye cornea with the help of a sterile blade. Your surgeon then uses a laser to remove very thin layers from the cornea.
    </li>
    <li>
        Intra-LASIK: In this procedure, your surgeon uses the laser instead of the blade to cut and reshape the cornea.
    </li>
    <li>
        Wavefront LASIK: One of the most modern and advanced technique is Wavefront LASIK. During this procedure, a map of the cornea by a 3-dimensional scan is produced. This surgery is more accurate, and the chances of gaining 20/20 vision improve after this procedure.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>BEFORE LASIK SURGERY:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Before the surgery, your eye surgeon will carry out a thorough eye screening to ensure that you are a suitable candidate and your eyes are healthy enough for this procedure. The eye doctor will evaluate the following things:
    </li>
    <li>
        Your surgeon will give guidelines which you have to follow before the surgery. You should not wear contact lenses for a certain amount of time as advised by your ophthalmologist. The surgeon will discuss important points such as what to expect during and after the procedure. The surgeon will evaluate your medical history along with the detailed eye examination. The initial tests before surgery include refraction, measuring corneal thickness, eye pressure, corneal mapping, and pupil dilation with retina evaluation.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>DURING LASIK PROCEDURE</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
    To prevent any kind of discomfort, your surgeon will give local anesthesia or can give medication before the surgery. Once your eyes are numbed, your eyes will be accurately positioned under the laser, and with the help of a lid speculum instrument, the eyelids will be kept open.
</li>
<li>
    Your surgeon may use an ink marker to mark the eye cornea before creating a thin flap. Then, with the help of another instrument called microkeratome, thin flap is created in the cornea. A suction ring may be used to prevent movement of the eye that could affect the quality of the flap.
</li>
<li>
    Once the flap is created and painlessly peeled back, your eye surgeon will use a computer to adjust the laser as per the refractive need. You will be asked to look at the light for a small duration and the surgeon will observe the eye through a microscope when the laser sends light pulses into the cornea. Through this step, the corneal tissue is reshaped with the help of laser and the flap is put back in place. This surgery only takes 5-10 minutes for each eye.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pimples</h2>
<h3>Overview of Pimples</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages.
    </li>
    <li>
        Effective acne treatments are available, but acne can be persistent. The pimples and bumps heal slowly, and when one begins to go away, others seem to crop up.
    </li>
    <li>
        Depending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress and scar the skin. The earlier you start treatment, the lower your risk of such problems.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Acne signs vary depending on the severity of your condition:
    </li>
    <li>Whiteheads (closed plugged pores)</li>
    <li>Blackheads (open plugged pores)</li>
    <li>Small red, tender bumps (papules)</li>
    <li>Large, solid, painful lumps under the skin (nodules)</li>
    <li>Painful, pus-filled lumps under the skin (cystic lesions)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Causes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Four main factors cause acne:
    </li>
    <li>Excess oil (sebum) production</li>
    <li>Hair follicles clogged by oil and dead skin cells</li>
    <li>Bacteria</li>
    <li>Inflammation</li>
</ul>
