        <h2> Overview OF Diabities </h2></U>
        
        <ul>
     <li>Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. The most common is type 2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't make enough insulin. In the past 3 decades the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels. Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself. For people living with diabetes, access to affordable treatment, including insulin, is critical to their survival. There is a globally agreed target to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity by 2025. </li>
<li>
        About 422 million people worldwide have diabetes, the majority living in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.5 million deaths are directly attributed to diabetes each year. Both the number of cases and the prevalence of diabetes have been steadily increasing over the past few decades.

<h2>Symptoms </h2>
<ul>
   <li>
    Symptoms of type 1 diabetes include the need to urinate often, thirst, constant hunger, weight loss, vision changes and fatigue. These symptoms may occur suddenly. Symptoms for type 2 diabetes are generally similar to those of type 1 diabetes but are often less marked. As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after onset, after complications have already arisen. For this reason, it is important to be aware of risk factors. 
   </li>
</ul>

<h2>Prevention and treatment</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Type 1 diabetes cannot currently be prevented. Effective approaches are available to prevent type 2 diabetes and to prevent the complications and premature death that can result from all types of diabetes. These include policies and practices across whole populations and within specific settings (school, home, workplace) that contribute to good health for everyone, regardless of whether they have diabetes, such as exercising regularly, eating healthily, avoiding smoking, and controlling blood pressure and lipids. </li>

   <li> The starting point for living well with diabetes is an early diagnosis – the longer a person lives with undiagnosed and untreated diabetes, the worse their health outcomes are likely to be. Easy access to basic diagnostics, such as blood glucose testing, should therefore be available in primary health care settings. Patients will need periodic specialist assessment or treatment for complications. </li>
    
    <li>A series of cost-effective interventions can improve patient outcomes, regardless of what type of diabetes they may have. These interventions include blood glucose control through a combination of diet, physical activity and, if necessary, medication; control of blood pressure and lipids to reduce cardiovascular risk and other complications; and regular screening for damage to the eyes, kidneys and feet to facilitate early treatment. </li>
</ul>
<h2>OVERVIEW of bp low</h2>
<ul>
<li>Low blood pressure is generally considered a blood pressure reading lower than 90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) for the top number (systolic) or 60 mm Hg for the bottom number (diastolic).

   <li>What's considered low blood pressure for one person might be OK for someone else. Low blood pressure might cause no noticeable symptoms, or it might cause dizziness and fainting. Sometimes, low blood pressure can be life-threatening.</li>
    
<li> The causes of low blood pressure range from dehydration to serious medical conditions. It's important to find out what's causing low blood pressure so that it can be treated, if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Low blood pressure (hypotension) symptoms may include:</li>

<li>Blurred or fading vision</li>
<li>Dizziness or lightheadedness</li>
<li>Fainting</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Trouble concentrating</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>For some people, low blood pressure may be a sign of an underlying health condition, especially when it drops suddenly or occurs with symptoms.</li>

<li>A sudden fall in blood pressure can be dangerous. A change of just 20 mm Hg — a drop from 110 mm Hg systolic to 90 mm Hg systolic, for example — can cause dizziness and fainting. And big drops, such as those caused by uncontrolled bleeding, severe infections or allergic reactions, can be life-threatening.</li>

<li>Extreme low blood pressure can lead to a condition known as shock. Symptoms of shock include:</li>

<li>Confusion, especially in older people</li>
<li>Cold, clammy skin</li>
<li>Decrease in skin coloration (pallor)</li>
<li>Rapid, shallow breathing</li>
<li>Weak and rapid pulse</li>
    
</ul>

    <h3>Conditions that can cause low blood pressure.</h3>
    <ul>
<li>Medical conditions that can cause low blood pressure include:</li>

<li>Pregnancy. Changes during pregnancy cause blood vessels to expand rapidly. The changes may cause blood pressure to drop. Low blood pressure is common in the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. Blood pressure usually returns to pre-pregnancy levels after giving birth.
Heart and heart valve conditions. A heart attack, heart failure, heart valve disease and an extremely low heart rate (bradycardia) can cause low blood pressure.</li>
<li>Hormone-related diseases (endocrine disorders). Conditions affecting the parathyroid or adrenal glands, such as Addison's disease, may cause blood pressure to drop. Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and, sometimes, diabetes also may lower blood pressure.</li>
<li> When the body doesn't have enough water, the amount of blood in the body (blood volume) decreases. This can cause blood pressure to drop. Fever, vomiting, severe diarrhea, overuse of diuretics and strenuous exercise can lead to dehydration.</li>
<li>Blood loss. Losing a lot of blood, such as from an injury or internal bleeding, also reduces blood volume, leading to a severe drop in blood pressure.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overview of bp high</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
Hypertension (high blood pressure) is when the pressure in your blood vessels is too high (140/90 mmHg or higher). It is common but can be serious if not treated.</li>
<li>
People with high blood pressure may not feel symptoms. The only way to know is to get your blood pressure checked.
</li>
<li>
Things that increase the risk of having high blood pressure include:
</li>
<li>older age </li>
<li>Genetics</li>
<li>Being overweight or obese</li>
<li>Not being physically active </li>
<li>High-salt diet</li>
<li>Drinking too much alcohol</li>
<li>Lifestyle changes like eating a healthier diet, quitting tobacco and being more active can
    </li>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Most people with hypertension don’t feel any symptoms. Very high blood pressures can cause headaches, blurred vision, chest pain and other symptoms. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Checking your blood pressure is the best way to know if you have high blood pressure. If hypertension isn’t treated, it can cause other health conditions like kidney disease, heart disease and stroke.
    </li>
    <li>
        People with very high blood pressure (usually 180/120 or higher) can experience symptoms including:
    </li>
    <li>severe headaches</li>
        <li>chest pain</li>
        <li>dizziness</li> 
        <li>difficulty breathing</li>
        <li>nausea</li>
        <li>vomiting</li>
        <li>blurred vision or other vision changes</li>
        <li>anxiety</li>
        <li>confusion</li>
        <li>buzzing in the ears</li>
        <li>nosebleeds</li>
        <li>abnormal heart rhythm</li>
        <li>If you are experiencing any of these symptoms and a high blood pressure, seek care immediately </li>
</ul>



<h2> Overview of vactionation</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Immunization is a global health and development success story, saving millions of lives every year. Vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with your body’s natural defences to build protection. When you get a vaccine, your immune system responds.</li>

<li>We now have vaccines to prevent more than 20 life-threatening diseases, helping people of all ages live longer, healthier lives. Immunization currently prevents 3.5-5 million deaths every year from diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza and measles.</li>

<li>Immunization is a key component of primary health care and an indisputable human right. It’s also one of the best health investments money can buy. Vaccines are also critical to the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks. They underpin global health security and will be a vital tool in the battle against antimicrobial resistance.</li>

<li>The Covid-19 pandemic, associated disruptions, and Covid-19 vaccination efforts strained health systems in 2020 and 2021, resulting in dramatic setbacks. However, from a global perspective recovery is on the horizon -  in 2022 diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DTP) immunization coverage, albeit unevenly between countries, has almost recovered to 2019 levels.</li>

<li>Measles, because of its high transmissibility, acts as a “canary in the coalmine”, quickly exposing any immunity gaps in the population. Still, 22 million children missed their routine first dose of measles vaccine in 2022, compared to 19 million in 2019.
