        <h2> Overview  OF Pregnancy </h2></U>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                Pregnancy is the period in which an egg cell is fertilized by a sperm to form a new cell, called the zygote, that eventually develops into a new human organism, to be born. </li>

            <li>The period of human pregnancy is 40 weeks from the date of the last menstrual period (LMP), or 38 weeks from the time of conception, on average. The former is taken as the beginning of pregnancy in this article.</li>
           
        </ul>
        <h2>Types of pregnancy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                
        Pregnancy can be single or multiple. The latter refers to conceiving two or more fetuses at the same time or conceiving one zygote which divides into two or more separate zygotes at a very early stage of development and forms two fetuses.
            </li>
<li>
       If the former, fraternal twins, triplets, quadruplets or quintuplets are formed. If the latter, identical twins (or more multiples) are born as they have the same genetic makeup. While identical twins are fairly common, identical multiples of higher order are very rare.
            </li>
        </ul>
<h2>Complications of pregnancy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                
      Miscarriage is most common during the first trimester of pregnancy. Other first-trimester complications include vaginal bleeding, ectopic pregnancy, and excessive nausea and vomiting.</li>
<li>
     If the mother decides to have prenatal testing for genetic defects in the baby, finding out about potential or confirmed fetal defects can cause significant stress for the rest of the pregnancy.</li>
    <li>
    In the second trimester, the risk of miscarriage drops dramatically, but preterm labor can still set in. Gestational diabetes mellitus, or high blood sugar levels during pregnancy, typically sets in during this period, as may pregnancy-induced hypertension.</li>
<li></li>
    Women may also suffer depression during pregnancy, known as prenatal depression. This is a serious condition that may interfere with everyday life.
            </li>
        </ul>
<h2>Health during pregnancy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                
                Eating for two is rarely needed as long as the diet is healthy and balanced. Folic acid in the form of a prenatal vitamin is essential to reduce the risk of the baby developing spina bifida, and a supplement containing vitamins and minerals will help ensure the mother gets proper amounts of these during her pregnancy.
            </li>
                <li>
                While the caloric intake is bound to increase, there is no need to double the intake. Small frequent meals are best to keep the blood sugar and energy level constant while preventing uncomfortable fulness.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most health services recommend that alcohol is avoided during pregnancy, also excessive (added) salt, sugar, and undercooked animal foods. Unpasteurized dairy foods and milk are considered a potential health risk, as are soft cheeses like Brie or Camembert cheese. It is also recommended that women limit their caffeine intake. The limit is about 200 mg a day, the amount in 12 oz coffee.
            </li>
            <li>
                Weight gain in pregnancy depends on the stage of pregnancy. Most often, women with normal singleton pregnancies gain 10-12 kg. dieting is not recommended during pregnancy, but women with obesity will probably do well to eat just enough to maintain their weight.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <U>
            <h2> Overview  OF MtP </h2></U>
<ul>
    <li>
        Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP), also known as abortion, refers to the medical procedure that terminates a pregnancy before the fetus reaches the stage of viability. It is a significant aspect of reproductive healthcare that addresses complex personal, medical, and ethical considerations. MTP allows women to make informed decisions about their bodies, health, and futures.
    </li>
    <li>
        The importance of MTP lies in providing women with the autonomy to choose whether to continue or end a pregnancy based on their circumstances. Reasons for seeking MTP can range from health risks to the mother, fetal abnormalities, contraceptive failure, economic factors, or personal choices. By offering safe and legal options for abortion, society recognizes and respects women's right to control their reproductive destinies.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>What they do for Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Procedure
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Medication Abortion (Early Pregnancy): Medication abortion, also known as the abortion pill, is used for terminating pregnancies in the early stages, typically up to 10 weeks from the last menstrual period. It involves a combination of two medications:

    </li>
    <li>
        Mifepristone: This medication blocks the hormone progesterone, which is essential for maintaining pregnancy. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Misoprostol: Taken a day or two after mifepristone, misoprostol induces uterine contractions to expel the embryo. 
    </li>
    <li>
        The process usually involves a follow-up appointment to ensure the pregnancy has been successfully terminated.
  
    </li>
</ul>

        <h3>What Are the Treatments for Miscarriage?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The first thing your doctor will try to do is prevent you from having a miscarriage. If the doctor thinks you’re at risk for having one, they may tell you to cut back on activity, including sex, until the signs are gone. Some recommend bed rest, although there’s no scientific evidence it’ll prevent a miscarriage. It can also raise your risk for other health issues. More often than not, there isn’t a lot your doctor can do to stop a miscarriage.

            </li>
<li>
    Treatment of a miscarriage, once it starts, depends on your symptoms. The main goal of treatment during and after a miscarriage is to prevent heavy bleeding (they’ll call it hemorrhaging) and infection.
</li>
<li>
    If vaginal bleeding fills more than one super sanitary pad an hour for 2 hours, call your doctor. Heavier bleeding and cramping often indicate that a miscarriage is happening. Most of the time, your body will pass all of the pregnancy-related tissue. The earlier you are in the pregnancy, the more likely your body will complete the miscarriage on its own.

</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Tests After a Miscarriage
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Most of the time, chances are good that the next pregancy after a miscarriage will be healthy. But if you have two or more miscarriages in a row, the doctor may suggest tests to find out if there’s a problem that you should treat before you try again. These could include:
 
            </li>
            <li>
                Imaging tests. There may be something wrong with the structure of your uterus that’s keeping you from carrying a baby to term. The doctor can check for this with an ultrasound, an X-ray or a hysteroscopy.

            </li>
            <li>Endometrial biopsy. During a hysteroscopy, your doctor may take a small piece of the lining of your uterus to look for abnormal cells.  </li>
            <li>
                Genetic tests.Chromosome problems are a common cause of miscarriages. You and your partner may get a karyotype test, which checks your chromosomes for anything unusual.

            </li>
            <li>
                Blood tests. The doctor may check levels of certain hormones. Blood tests can also reveal risk factors for miscarriage, like diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and blood clotting problems.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Physical Recovery After Miscarriage   
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It usually doesn’t take long for your body to recover from a miscarriage. You may feel better within a few hours, or it could take a few weeks. Doctors recommend you don’t have sex or put anything in your vagina, like a tampon, for 2 weeks. That’s to lower the chances of an infection. You‘ll probably have your period again in 4-6 weeks. 

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Emotional Recovery After Miscarriage   </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It's common to feel sad after losing a pregnancy. Many couples feel the grief of losing a child. This is normal, so allow yourself time to grieve. Consider joining a support group where you can talk about your experience and feelings with others who’ve had a miscarriage. Family and friends may want to comfort you, but may feel like they don't know how. If you can, let them know that you need their support, tell them what they can do, and rely on their help.
