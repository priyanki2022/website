         OVERVIEW OF IMPLANT </h2></U>
         <h3>Background</h3>
         <ul>
      <li>When a tooth is lost due to injury or disease, a person can experience complications such as rapid bone loss, defective speech, or changes to chewing patterns that result in discomfort. Replacing a lost tooth with a dental implant can significantly improve the patient's quality of life and health.
        </li>
      <li>Dental implant systems consist of a dental implant body and dental implant abutment and may also include an abutment fixation screw. The dental implant body is surgically inserted in the jawbone in place of the tooth's root. The dental implant abutment is usually attached to the implant body by the abutment fixation screw and extends through gums into the mouth to support the attached artificial teeth.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recommendations for Patients</h2>
    
           Before choosing dental implants, talk to your dental provider about the potential benefits and risks, and whether you are a candidate for the procedure.

         <h3>Things to consider:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Your overall health is an important factor in determining whether you are a good candidate for dental implants, how long it will take to heal, and how long the implant may stay in place.</li>
    <li>Ask your dental provider what brand and model of dental implant system is being used and keep this information for your records.</li>
    <li>Smoking may affect the healing process and decrease the long-term success of the implant.</li>
    <li>The healing process for the implant body may take several months or longer, during which time you typically have a temporary abutment in place of the tooth.</li>
    </ul>

   <h4> After the dental implant procedure:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Carefully follow the oral hygiene instructions given to you by your dental provider. Regularly cleaning the implant and surrounding teeth is very important for long-term success of the implant.</li>
<li>Schedule regular visits with your dental provider.</li>
<li>If your implant feels loose or painful, tell your dental provider right away.</li>
</ul>

<u><h2>OVERVIEW OF BRACES</h2></u>
<h3>What are braces?</h3>
Dental braces straighten your teeth and correct a wide range of orthodontic issues, such as:

<ul type="disk">

    <li>
        Crooked teeth.</li>
<li>Crowded teeth.</li>
<li>Gapped teeth.</li>
<li>Malocclusion (issues with the way your teeth fit together).</li>
<li>Many children and teens wear braces, but adult braces are common, too. In fact, about 20% of all orthodontic patients in the United States are over the age of 18.</li>

<li>In most cases, orthodontists place braces. But some general dentists offer them too.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    What are the types of braces?
    </h3> 
    There are several different types of braces. The type that’s best for you depends on a few factors, including the kind of issue you have, the severity of your condition and your personal preferences.
    <h5>Metal braces</h5>
    <center>
    <img src="/braces metal.jpg" width="400px">
</center>
    <ul type="disk">
        <li>
            When you think of braces, traditional metal braces might be what you imagine. Metal braces use stainless steel bands, brackets and wires to gently shift your teeth over time.</li>

<li>A dentist or orthodontist will bond (glue) a bracket on each tooth, then place a thin, flexible archwire over the brackets. Tiny elastic bands called ligatures keep the wire firmly in place.</li>

<li>Metal braces are visible when you smile. You can choose clear or tooth-colored ligatures to make your braces less noticeable. Or, if you’re feeling festive, you can choose brightly colored ligatures.
 </li></ul>
    
    <h5>Ceramic braces</h5>
    <center>
 <img src="/braces Ceramic.jpg" width="400px"></center>
 <ul type="disk">
    <li>Ceramic braces — sometimes called clear braces — work the same way as metal braces. The key difference is that the brackets, wires and ligatures are tooth-colored, so they blend in with your smile. Ceramic braces are still visible, but they’re less noticeable. One drawback to ceramic braces is that they’re more fragile than metal braces, so they’re more likely to break.</li></ul>
    <h5>Lingual braces</h5>
    <center>
    <img src="/braces lingual.jpg" width="400px">
    </center>
    <ul type="disk">
    <li>Lingual braces are similar to traditional braces. But they go on the back surfaces of your teeth instead of the front. Most people who choose lingual braces do so because they don’t want other people to be able to tell they have braces.
    </li></ul>
    <h5>Self-ligating braces</h5>
    <center>
    <img src="/braces self ligating.jpg" width="400px">
    </center>
    <ul type="disk">
    <li>Self-ligating braces look similar to traditional metal braces. The main difference is that, instead of ligatures (tiny elastic bands), self-ligating braces use a built-in system to hold the archwire in place.
    </li></ul>
    <h5>What age is best for braces?</h5>
    <ul type="disk">
        <li>You’re never too old for orthodontics. That said, the best time for braces is generally between the ages of 9 and 14. At this point, your jaws and facial bones are more malleable (flexible) because they’re still developing. Adult braces are just as effective, but it might take a little longer to achieve the desired results.</li>
        
    </ul>
    <u><h2>Risks / Benefits</h2></u>
    <h3>What are the benefits of dental braces?</h3>
    The most obvious advantage of braces is a straighter, more beautiful smile. But braces can also:
    <ul type="disk">
        <li>Make your teeth easier to clean.</li>
        <li>Help prevent cavities and gum disease.</li>
        <li>Correct temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders.</li>
        <li>Restore proper functions like chewing and speaking.</li>
        In short, braces can improve the health, function and appearance of your smile.</ul>

        <h3>What are the normal side effects of braces?</h3>
        There are some mild, expected side effects of braces, including:
        <ul type="disk">
            <li>Temporary discomfort (which usually occurs the first day and any time your dentist tightens your braces).</li>
            <li>Irritation on your tongue, lips or inner cheeks.</li>
            <li>Jaw pain.</li>
            <li>Difficulty eating (especially after a tightening).</li></ul>

            You can manage most of these side effects with over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers. You can also purchase dental wax for braces at your local pharmacy to help with irritation inside your mouth. Simply place some wax over any rough-feeling brackets or wire.<br><br>
