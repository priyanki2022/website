      <h2><u>overview  of knee replacement</u></h2>
      <h3>What is a knee replacement surgery?</h3>
      <ul>
 <li>
    Knee replacement, also called knee arthroplasty or total knee replacement, is a surgical procedure to resurface a knee damaged
    by arthritis. Metal and plastic parts are used to cap the ends of the bones that form the knee joint, along with the kneecap. 
    This surgery may be considered for someone who has severe arthritis or a severe knee injury.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
    Various types of arthritis may affect the knee joint. Osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that affects mostly 
    middle-aged and older adults,may cause the breakdown of joint cartilage and adjacent bone in the knees. Rheumatoid arthritis,
    which causes inflammation of the synovial membrane and results in excessive synovial fluid, can lead to pain and stiffness. 
    Traumatic arthritis, arthritis due to injury, may cause damage to the cartilage of the knee.</li>

   <li>The goal of knee replacement surgery is to resurface the parts of the knee joint that have been damaged and to relieve knee 
    pain that cannot be controlled by other treatments.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Anatomy of the knee</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
Joints are the areas where 2 or more bones meet. Most joints are mobile, allowing the bones to move.
Basically, the knee is 2 long leg bones held together by muscles, ligaments, and tendons.
Each bone end is covered with a layer of cartilage that absorbs shock and protects the knee.
</li>
<li>
    There are 2 groups of muscles involved in the knee, including the quadriceps muscles (located on the front of the thighs), 
    which straighten the legs,and the hamstring muscles (located on the back of the thighs), which bend the leg at the knee.
</li>
<li>
    Tendons are tough cords of connective tissue that connect muscles to bones. Ligaments are elastic bands of tissue that connect
    bone to bone. Some ligaments of the knee provide stability and protection of the joints, while other ligaments limit forward
    and backward movement of the tibia (shin bone).
</li>
</ul>
<h4>The knee consists of the following:</h4>
<ul>
  
        <li>Tibia. This is the shin bone or larger bone of the lower leg.</li>
        <li>Femur. This is the thighbone or upper leg bone.</li>
        <li>Patella. This is the kneecap.</li>
        <li>Cartilage. A type of tissue that covers the surface of a bone at a joint. Cartilage helps reduce the friction of movement within a joint.</li>
        <li>Ligament. A type of tough, elastic connective tissue that surrounds the joint to give support and limits the joint's movement.</li>
        <li>Tendon. A type of tough connective tissue that connects muscles to bones and helps to control movement of the joint.</li>
        <li>Meniscus. A curved part of cartilage in the knees and other joints that acts as a shock absorber, increases contact area, and deepens the knee joint.</li>
    
</ul>
<h3>Reasons for the procedure</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Knee replacement surgery is a treatment for pain and disability in the knee. 
        The most common condition that results in the need for knee replacement surgery is osteoarthritis.
    </li>
</ul>



<h2><u>overview  of knee Pain</u></h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Knee pain is a common complaint that affects people of all ages. Knee pain may be the result of an injury, 
        such as a ruptured ligament or torn cartilage. Medical conditions — including arthritis, gout and infections — 
        also can cause knee pain.

    </li>
    <li>
        Many types of minor knee pain respond well to self-care measures. Physical therapy and knee braces also can help relieve pain. 
        In some cases, however, your knee may require surgical repair.
    </li>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        The location and severity of knee pain may vary, depending on the cause of the problem. 
        Signs and symptoms that sometimes accompany knee pain include:
    </li>
<li>Swelling and stiffness</li>
<li>Redness and warmth to the touch</li>
<li>Weakness or instability</li>
<li>Popping or crunching noises</li>
<li>Inability to fully straighten the knee</li> 
</ul>
<h3>Injuries</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        A knee injury can affect any of the ligaments, tendons or fluid-filled sacs (bursae) that surround your knee joint as well as
         the bones, cartilage and ligaments that form the joint itself. Some of the more common knee injuries include:</li>

         <li> ACL injury:
An ACL injury is a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) — one of four ligaments that connect your shinbone to your thighbone. 
An ACL injury is particularly common in people who play basketball, soccer or other sports that require sudden changes in direction.</li>
<li>Fractures: The bones of the knee, including the kneecap (patella), can be broken during falls or auto accidents.
     Also, people whose bones have been weakened by osteoporosis can sometimes sustain a knee fracture simply by stepping wrong.</li>
<li>Torn meniscus. The meniscus is the tough, rubbery cartilage that acts as a shock absorber between your shinbone and thighbone.
     It can be torn if you suddenly twist your knee while bearing weight on it.</li>
<li>Knee bursitis. Some knee injuries cause inflammation in the bursae, the small sacs of fluid that cushion the outside of your 
    knee joint so that tendons and ligaments glide smoothly over the joint.</li>
<li>Patellar tendinitis. Tendinitis causes irritation and inflammation of one or more tendons — the thick, fibrous tissues that 
    attach muscles to bones. This inflammation can happen when there's an injury to the patellar tendon, which runs from the kneecap (patella) to the shinbone and
 allows you to kick, run and jump. Runners, skiers, cyclists, and those involved in jumping sports and activities may develop patellar tendinitis.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>How does the shoulder work?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
Your shoulders each have two joints, making them the most flexible parts of your body.
    </li>
    <li>The main shoulder joint  the glenohumeral is a ball-and-socket joint. It’s called this because the top of the upper
        arm bone the humerus  is shaped like a ball. This ball fits into the shoulder blade bone, which acts as the socket,
         giving your shoulder a wide range of movement.
    </li>
    <li>
        But, the shoulder socket is very small, compared to other ball-and-socket joints, such as the hip. It’s held together and 
        controlled by a covering of muscles, which are secured to the bones by strong cords called tendons.

    </li>
    <li>
        These muscles and tendons form a capsule around the joint and support its movements, but can make it more likely to
         dislocate than other joints.
    </li>
    <li>
        Inside the capsule is the synovium, which produces fluid that lubricates the joint and keeps the cartilage healthy. 
        The cartilage helps protect your bones from any impact and sits between the bones of your shoulder joints to stop them 
        rubbing together.

    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Causes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most shoulder problems only affect a small area and should last a relatively short time.</li>
<li>But sometimes the problem in your shoulder could be part of a wider, long-term condition such as, osteoarthritis or 
    polymyalgia rheumatica.</li>
<li>It’s fairly common for people with rheumatoid arthritis to have pain and swelling in their shoulders.</li>
<li>Osteoarthritis is less likely to affect your shoulders than other joints, unless you’ve injured them in the past.</li>
</ul>

There are several other possible causes of shoulder pain, such as:

<h3>Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis)</h3>
    <ul>
<li>If you have a frozen shoulder the capsule around the joint has become too tight, stopping you moving your shoulder. We don’t always know why this happens, though sometimes it follows an injury, a heart attack or stroke, and it’s more common in people with diabetes who can’t produce insulin properly.
    The condition will usually resolve itself in time, but it may take as long as two to three years.</li>
        <li>The pain can be severe and you may feel sudden muscle pains, called muscle spasms, especially at night. You may need painkillers to help.</li>
            <li>Sometimes a treatment called a volume hydrodilatation is used for frozen shoulder. This involves a combination of:</li>
            <li>Physiotherapy or a steroid injection on its own may also help.</li>
</ul>
<h2>overview of Spinal pain</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    Back pain is one of the most common reasons people seek medical help or miss work.
    Back pain is a leading cause of disability worldwide.
</li>
<li>
    Fortunately, measures can help prevent or relieve most back pain episodes, especially for people younger than age 60.
    If prevention fails, simple home treatment and using the body correctly often will heal the back within a few weeks.
    Surgery is rarely needed to treat back pain.

</li>
<center>
    <img src="/spinal 3.jpg" width="250px">
</center>
<ul>
<h3>Symptoms </h3>
<li>Back pain can range from a muscle aching to a shooting, burning or stabbing sensation. Also, the pain can radiate down a leg. Bending, twisting, lifting, standing or walking can make it worse.
</li>
<li>
    Muscle or ligament strain. Repeated heavy lifting or a sudden awkward movement can strain back muscles and spinal ligaments. For people in poor physical condition, constant strain on the back can cause painful muscle spasms.
</li>
<li>Bulging or ruptured disks. Disks act as cushions between the bones in the spine. The soft material inside a disk can bulge or rupture and press on a nerve. However, a bulging or ruptured disk might not cause back pain. Disk disease is often found on spine X-rays, CT scans or MRIs done for another reason.</li>
<li>Arthritis. Osteoarthritis can affect the lower back. In some cases, arthritis in the spine can lead to a narrowing of the space around the spinal cord, a condition called spinal stenosis.</li>
<li>Osteoporosis. The spine's vertebrae can develop painful breaks if the bones become porous and brittle.
Ankylosing spondylitis, also called axial spondyloarthritis. This inflammatory disease can cause some of the bones in the spine to fuse. This makes the spine less flexible.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risk factors</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Anyone can develop back pain, even children and teens. These factors can increase the risk of developing back pain:
    </li>
    <li>Age. Back pain is more common with age, starting around age 30 or 40. </li>
<li>Lack of exercise. Weak, unused muscles in the back and abdomen might lead to back pain.</li>
<li>Excess weight. Excess body weight puts extra stress on the back.</li>
<li>Improper lifting. Using the back instead of the legs can lead to back pain.</li>
